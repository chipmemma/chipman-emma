First thing I noticed is the comparison with hacking and painting. I'm actually an artist as well as a computer science major so maybe I should get into hacking. I am a little confused about saying that software designers aren't engineers becasue they decide what to do. Don't they also need to then do it and implement it??? My older sister is in academia so I can totally relate to the part about exploring virgin territory by researching things no one else wants too. It does feel like a kind of stupid process. Unintended consequences. I definitely also feel the frustration of having being told to write something out before coding it. Honestly most of the time I'll do it, code it, it won't work and I'll think of something better, and then just stick to code and fix it. I honestly don't mind just being told what needs to be done with the code so maybe I'm not cut out to be a hacker per se. The reference to open source was nice. I think I should look at more people's code. Glad to see that empathy is important.
