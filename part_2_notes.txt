The pipelining is really cool because it keeps things so concise. I'm sure there's a lot of available code online that can make making new programs much easier. Another thing I noticed which is sort of unrelated is that this video looks so old! I suppose it is really simple logic to get programs to be made of other programs. It's interesting how big a deal being able to store files is and was. I didn't realize pipes could connect code written in other languages. Hearing C be called a high level language was kind of a shock.
